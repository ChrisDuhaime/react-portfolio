##  Chris Duhaime react-portfolio

# Summary

On this assignment I had to take our portfolio and convert it into React.  Using JSX Components I made a 1 page application that loaded each page as users clicked on the Navigation tabs.  It is deployed live using GH-pages here https://chrisduhaime.github.io/react-portfolio/
